## Requirements


## Instructions

### For Users

### For Contributors

The following instructions are for building and running the project from scratch.
To build the visualization you must have Unity3D installed (only in Windows and Mac)


## Why V-REP

- Fully featured Robotics simulation software
- Cross platform support: Windows, Linux, MacOS (key difference from Gazebo)
- Standalone: ROS is not required
- Good interoperability: ROS Interface, RemoteAPI, Support for Python, MATLAB, C++ and others

## Why Unity3D

Unity3D is chosen for the visualization of the robotic simulations (instead of V-REP) for the following reasons:
- Superior graphics and photorealism
- Multi platform support: Windows, Linux, MacOS as well as WebGL
- More flexibility in terms of physics engines. This is especially useful for medical simulations where it is 
  important to visualize and manipulate non-rigid objects. (TODO: Integration with SOFA framework)
- Support for VR & AR
